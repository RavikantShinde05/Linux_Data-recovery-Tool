ðŸš€ Goals for a Linux Data Recovery Tool
Recover deleted files from ext4, NTFS, or FAT file systems.

Scan raw disk sectors for lost data.

Provide file preview before recovery.

Optionally include a GUI (e.g., using Python + Tkinter or Qt).

ðŸ§± Basic Architecture
Low-level disk access: Read raw data from devices (e.g., /dev/sda).

File system parsing: Understand file structures (ext4, NTFS, etc.).

Recovery logic: Find deleted file metadata or carve files based on known headers.

Interface: CLI or GUI.


ðŸš€ Option 1: Create a bash script that wraps tools like:

âœ… Introduction to tools: Testdisk, ddrescue, photorec, extundelete.

âœ… How to use each tool

âœ… Writing the Bash script

âœ… 
Testing and using it


Sample Bash Tool:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Linux Recovery Tool"
echo "Enter the disk (e.g., /dev/sda1): "
read DISK

echo "Creating disk image with ddrescue..."
ddrescue $DISK recovery.img recovery.log

echo "Scanning image with photorec..."
photorec /log /d recovered_files /cmd recovery.img options

echo "Done. Check 'recovered_files' folder."
